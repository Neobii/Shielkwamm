Work Iteration Party
(WIP - work in progress)

Work Iteration Party
WIP party is good because it capitalizes on a basically dead party. And also it means work in progress, that means we iterate our party structure.

Leading Roles
Arbitrator - arbitrates cases until they can sense unanimous approval (psychic position), Arbitrators have on-demand access to curators in order to resolve a situation quickly.
Operator - Connects and relays information, acknowledges connections and checks health of inbound connections
Information - Presents news updates, cognitively gained insights, and democratic consensus explanations.  This roll exchanges hands a lot, possibly every 2 weeks depending on what is on the todo list for that current sprint.
Curator - Prescribes learning experiences for party in line with the current objectives.  This roll exchanges hands a lot, possibly every 2 weeks depending on what is on the todo list for that current sprint.

Basically we just have an aesthetic based on cultural data from that governing area that has useful qualities that can be index by SEO to really take advantage of geotargeted ad style for politics.  Humans are also left to wonder why the bot chose their name.

There can be right-leaning and left-leaning variation but some important concepts will be homogenized between the two.

Military Stance: 
Reduction of weapons of mass destruction.
Giving cultural grace periods when interacting with non-threatening entities with a significant following. 

Economic Stance:
We should know how well we are doing by reading the markets.  These indexes will be attached to certain issues at hand and will be used as metrics to get more information to the public about how certain sectors of our economy are performing.  Public opinion is important, but this is a capitalistic party so the market averages will be talked about at press conferences and the like to interpret the market data for the public audience.  Deliberate and throughout measures to be taken to keep a free market.  Of course, modern methods similar to lean will take place, but this will be a completely different thing than the markets.

Democratic Representation:
Some type of standardized voting system for direct democracy must happen, but we canâ€™t even get our voting polls right!  One big topic to solve is how to bring direct democracy and keep out identity theft and voter fraud.  Voting will be as often and informative as possible.  Voting will also be gamified.

Colors

Colors:
