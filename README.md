`+☸ lvl 5: [==========] > ==== Shielkwámḿ ====`
 
## *Welcome weary adventurers to ==== Shielkwámḿ ====||*
 
*The object of this game is to be able to profess the △Shìelkwamm△ into the ◯.*
 
△Shìelkwamm△ 101: This first 7 seconds of youTube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcouWKjYtxQ contains all the ancient secrets needed to learn how to say ==== Shilililelkwamm ====.  If you do not know how to say ▵Shielḱwamm▵ in a public domain and ☴ is alerted to your unauthorized use of △Shielkwamm△, you get banned from ==== Shielḱwamḿ ====.  
 
☴ Zorking - anyone can zork, but it may can cause ▵Shiélkwámm▵ to ++Ø+-.
Example Zork: https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9d/Make-a-Realistic-Farting-Noise-Step-8.jpg/aid902283-v4-728px-Make-a-Realistic-Farting-Noise-Step-8.jpg.webp.  
 
◯ ▵BwamBwam▵ or ⭘ BwamBwam will appear when you least expect it.  If you missed it this time, no ?x, just work on Zorking until ▵BwamBwam▵. To see the ▵BwamBwam▵, you need a relaxed open mind and be kind to your fellow adventurers until ▵BwamBwam▵ appears again.  When you understand Zorking, you are expected to help maintain the ▵BwamBwam▵.  Zorkers are not allowed to fly the ◯, until they are given ▵BwamBwam▵ privileges from those who can pronounce, ==== Shielkwámm ====.
 
## If you master ▵Zorking▵, then you can see △BwamBwam△; if you can see ◯, then you are allowed to say ==== Shïelllllkawamm ====.
 
Warning: Not all ☴ are +⭘.  However, it is the duty for ☴ to work together to get ◯.  Individuals can and will use any means necissary to ⭘--.  Unfortunately it is not likely that ⭘ will reach △Shielḱwamm△, but it might indeed be possible to ⭘:⭘.
 
If you cannot play △Shìelkwamm△ anymore, I understand. ❤JUST LEAVE (((((((🕑))))))) ~|~.
 
*And remember, 🦕.*

🍕🖌 }}} - similar, I want to try and explain a hard concept, but I don't have enough clear headed space to give you the answer I want to so I'd rather omit it.  I can remember in my programming days, one piece of bad code stayed with me for a while.

Sometimes this happens and even though you had good ++🖌🖌.  If you see this, {{{ --🖌__ }}} that probably we need to reduce overhead, and the only way of me doing that right now is devOps and lean.
 
I know in a lot of industries, the creatives are allowed to pester people for ::feels::, that's cool.  We'll all find a balance, ==== yesterday_thatWouldBeGreat🖌🖌🖌 ====.
